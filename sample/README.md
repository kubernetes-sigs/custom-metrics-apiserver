# Sample API Server

This is a sample of how to write a custom metrics API server using this
library.  See the [README](/README.md) and [getting started
guide](/docs/getting-started.md) for more information.

The main entrypoint lives in [main.go](main.go), while the provider
implementations live in [provider/provider.go](provider/provider.go).
